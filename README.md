# COFs-dimensionality-prediction.-Boosted-Neural-Network

The offline calculator of the probability of 2D or 3D structures by Neural Network (39 sigmoidal activation functions, 1 layer). F1 = 1.00, Accuracy = 100% - both in training, and in validation. Based on the study provided within the JMP Discovery Summit Americas 2021: "Modern Approaches in Classification of Covalent Organic Frameworks by Textural Properties Using JSL" (https://community.jmp.com/t5/Discovery-Summit-Americas-2021/Modern-Approaches-in-Classification-of-Covalent-Organic/ta-p/398709). 

The Neural Network comprises 10 continuous and 2 categorical inputs (variables) for 576 structures after the data pre-processing: cleaning from the outliers, zero values. No missing values were detected.
